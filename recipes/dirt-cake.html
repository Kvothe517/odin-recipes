    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dirt cake recipe is a great conversation piece at parties — adults love it as much as children do. Garnish the flower pot cake with gummy worms; display it with a new garden trowel and artificial flowers for the full effect.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>32 ounces chocolate sandwich cookies with creme filling</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>

            <li>3 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
            <li>2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

            <li>Finely crush chocolate cookies in a food processor; set crumbs aside.</li>
