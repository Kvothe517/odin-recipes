    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a traditional Christmas cookie recipe that we have had in our family for years. All I did was change the shape to make them look like fingers for our annual Halloween party. The cookies make a great conversation piece. My guests loved them!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole almonds</li>
            <li>1 (.75 ounce) tube red decorating gel</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the butter, sugar, egg, almond extract, and vanilla extract in a mixing bowl. Beat together with an electric mixer; gradually add the flour, baking powder, and salt, continually beating; refrigerate 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from refrigerator in small amounts. Scoop 1 heaping teaspoon at a time onto a piece of waxed paper. Use the waxed paper to roll the dough into a thin finger-shaped cookie. Press one almond into one end of each cookie to give the appearance of a long fingernail. Squeeze cookie near the tip and again near the center of each to give the impression of knuckles. You can also cut into the dough with a sharp knife at the same points to help give a more finger-like appearance. Arrange the shaped cookies on the baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are slightly golden in color, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the almond from the end of each cookie; squeeze a small amount of red decorating gel into the cavity; replace the almond to cause the gel to ooze out around the tip of the cookie.</li>
        </ol>
